what is orchestration

MAKING ORCHESTRATION MAGICAL WITH MAGE

WHAT WE WILL BUILD
mage and postgres are going to be running in a docker container. 
we're going to take a dataset, do some transformations on it, load it into postgres,
then do some more transformation.

Architecture
Extract
- Pull data from a source (API)

Transform
- Data cleaning, transformation and partitioning

Load
API to Mage, Mage to Postgres, GCS, BigQuery

WHAT IS ORCHESTRATION?
Process of dependency management, facilitated through automation.
Data orchestrator manages scheduling, triggering, monitoring and
even resource allocation

every workflow requires sequential steps.
steps=tasks
workflows=DAGs

A GOOD ORCHESTRATOR HANDLES ...
- workflow management
- automation
- error handling
- recovery
- monitoring and handling
- resource optimization
- observability
- debugging
- compliance/auditing

A GOOD ORHESTRATOR PRIORITIZES...
The developer experience
- flow state
"I need to switch between 7 tools/services"

- Feedback loops
"I spent 5 hours locally testing this DAG"

- Cognitive load
"How much do you need to know to do your job?"
